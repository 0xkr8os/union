# add commit SHA to ignore

# GitHub can use this file to ignore certain commits when calculating the blame for a file.
# This is useful for ignoring commits that are not relevant to the code,
# such as large formatting changes: for example changing quotes from single to double.

# format FE files with biome instead of prettier
