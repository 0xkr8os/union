# add commit SHA to ignore

# GitHub can use this file to ignore certain commits when calculating the blame for a file.
# This is useful for ignoring commits that are not relevant to the code,
# such as large formatting changes: for example changing quotes from single to double.

# Next 5 commits are part of migrating to biome linter and formatter for js,ts,tsx,astro,svelte files
