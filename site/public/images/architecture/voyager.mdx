IBC relays on off-chain actors transferring packets and proofs between chains. Voyager is our in-house relayer, allowing us to support new networks without waiting for up-stream support.

## Architecture

We have opted for an event driven architecture, where the application uses an internal memory queue for observed events and I/O.

Voyager integrates over [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) with Galois to offload computation to dedicated hardware, with pending support for proving markets.
