			<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
				Today, we are happy to announce the work we have done so far on Union, the trustless
				infrastructure layer for web3. Over the last six months, unionlabs was founded with nothing
				but an idea, a diverse skillset, and a mission to ship zkp powered infra everywhere.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
				We spent months building in stealthmode, heads-down, as we validated our technical
				assumptions. The product of that is the Union testnet, CometBLS and Galois. These components
				allowed us to achieve <b>IBC to Ethereum, the endgame.</b>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
				Union is designed around a few key principles: permissonless interopability, censorship
				resistance, and decentralized infrastrucutre. Anyone should be allowed to transact, with any
				counterparty, on any chain, and this system may not rely on massive, closed source
				infrastructure.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
				With Union, we can bring any asset natively to any chain, hook into account abstraction with
				ICQ, and access coproccors and storage proofs.
