preview: "Today, we are happy to announce the work we have done so far on Union, the trustless infrastructure layer. Over the last six months, unionlabs was founded with nothing but an idea, a diverse skillset, and a mission to ship zkp powered infra everywhere."

We spent months building in stealthmode, heads-down, as we validated our technical assumptions. The product of that is the Union testnet, CometBLS, Voyager, and Galois. These components allowed us to achieve **IBC to Ethereum, the endgame**.`

Union is designed around a few key principles: permissonless interopability, censorship resistance, and decentralized infrastrucutre. Anyone should be allowed to transact, with any counterparty, on any chain, and this system may not rely on massive, closed source infrastructure.

With Union, we can bring any asset natively to any chain, hook into account abstraction with ICQ, and access coprocecors and storage proofs.

## The mission continues

Our journey has been marked by relentless dedication to our mission: to provide trustless financial infrastructure. As we look ahead, our mission remains at the forefront of everything we do.

### 1. Fight Censorship

As crypto is gearing up for the next bull market, we need to ensure we do not lose our original ethos: **to be sovereign**. While nations are inhibiting people from ownership, blocking bank transactions, censoring protocols, web3 must remain a safe haven.

### 2. Meaningful Interoperability

Interoperability is not enough. Building infrastructure is not enough. Announcements and marketing was never enough. We need a thriving cross-chain ecosystem of appchains, L1's and L2's, where liquidity is abundant and incentives are aligned. Ship meaningful products to end users.

### 1. Expand and Scale

Thriving web3 infrastructure should be accessible to everyone. This means not only increasing the number of supported blockchains but also fostering a community of developers, users, and partners who share our vision. We can build an interconnected world that transcends borders.
