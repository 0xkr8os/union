<h2>The Journey So Far</h2>
<div class="subtitle">2023-09-26 - @union_build</div>
<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
	Today, we are happy to announce the work we have done so far on Union, the trustless
	infrastructure layer for web3. Over the last six months, unionlabs was founded with nothing but an
	idea, a diverse skillset, and a mission to ship zkp powered infra everywhere.
</p>
<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
	We spent months building in stealthmode, heads-down, as we validated our technical assumptions.
	The product of that is the Union testnet, CometBLS and Galois. These components allowed us to
	achieve <b>IBC to Ethereum, the endgame.</b>
</p>
<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
	Union is designed around a few key principles: permissonless interopability, censorship
	resistance, and decentralized infrastrucutre. Anyone should be allowed to transact, with any
	counterparty, on any chain, and this system may not rely on massive, closed source infrastructure.
</p>
<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
	With Union, we can bring any asset natively to any chain, hook into account abstraction with ICQ,
	and access coproccors and storage proofs.
