# The Journey So Far
2023-09-26 - [@union_build](https://x.com/union_build)

Today, we are happy to announce the work we have done so far on Union, the trustless
infrastructure layer for web3. Over the last six months, unionlabs was founded with nothing but an
idea, a diverse skillset, and a mission to ship zkp powered infra everywhere.

We spent months building in stealthmode, heads-down, as we validated our technical assumptions.
The product of that is the Union testnet, CometBLS and Galois. These components allowed us to
achieve **IBC to Ethereum, the endgame.**

Union is designed around a few key principles: permissonless interopability, censorship
resistance, and decentralized infrastrucutre. Anyone should be allowed to transact, with any
counterparty, on any chain, and this system may not rely on massive, closed source infrastructure.

With Union, we can bring any asset natively to any chain, hook into account abstraction with ICQ,
and access coproccors and storage proofs.
