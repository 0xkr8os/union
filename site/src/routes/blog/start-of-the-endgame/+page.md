Galois and CometBLS have been live on our internal testnets for a while, but now we are ready to share a brief demo in anticipation of Cosmoverse. This is the **first, tangible implementation** of an effort that has been going on for the last few years by many different teams. We proudly present the first IBC connection to Ethereum.

Below is a live view of two smart contracts using General Message Passing (GMP) to play pingpong. Under the hood, [Galois]() is generating zero knowledge proofs to update lightclient state. Voyager is handling IBC relaying between `union-testnet-3` and `sepolia`. 

## Next Steps

The testnet does not have a live explorer yet, we'll be deploying that in the coming weeks, including a faucet and token transfers. 

Our next demonstration will show erc20 to native token transfers, setting the foundation for accessing Ethereum assets natively on any appchain.
