As we continue onboarding validators and expanding the testnet, we'll populate this page with FAQs in regard to becoming a validator on the Union Testnet.

### How can I become a validator?

We started our testnet with the goal of onboarding 64 validators. The sign-up form for these first 64 slots has been closed.

We have now expanded `union-testnet-6` to support 128 validators. Please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/union-build) for more information.

### Do you have any public REST/RPC/GRPC endpoints?

Yes, you can find them listed on the [Public Endpoints](../public-endpoints) page.

### Why can't I submit transactions to `localhost` when using `docker run`?

Ensure you have exposed your host machine's network via the `--network` flag in docker.

### My query commands aren't using values from my client config?

Due to [an issue in the cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18868), commands using AutoCLI do not respect the `--home` flag and instead always try and read the default home. As a temporary fix, we've removed the behavior reading the default home, always require a `--home` flag, and moved all `tx` commands away from AutoCLI. However, `query` commands still use AutoCLI and won't read the `--home` flag.

To get around this behavior, we suggest always supplying `--node` and `--chain-id` when using query commands.
