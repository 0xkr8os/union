As we continue onboarding validators and expanding the testnet, we'll populate this page with FAQs in regard to becoming a validator on the Union Testnet.

## Questions & Answers

### How can I become a validator?

We started our testnet with the goal of onboarding 64 validators. The sign-up form for these first 64 slots has been closed. 

We have now expanded `union-testnet-5` to support 128 validators. We will announce more details on how the public can join the network in the coming weeks. Please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/union-build) to get the latest news.

### Do you have any public REST/RPC/GRPC endpoints?

Yes, you can find them listed on the [Public Endpoints](../public-endpoints) page.

### Why can't I submit transactions to `localhost` when using `docker run`?

Ensure you have exposed your host machine's network via the `--network` flag in docker.

### Other questions?
