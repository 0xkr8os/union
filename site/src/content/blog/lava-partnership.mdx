Union, the sovereign interoperability layer, has formed a strategic partnership with [Lava](https://www.lavanet.xyz/), the modular access layer for Web3, marked by the announcement of an Incentivized Public Remote Procedure Call (ipRPC) campaign with a rewards pool worth $100K in token rewards. This alliance will also see Lava become the modular RPC and access layer connecting users to Union’s testnet.

Following Union’s mainnet launch slated for this summer, node operators will have the opportunity to become Union RPC providers through Lava, streamlining the process for developers by consolidating providers into a single access point. Campaign participants stand to receive a share of the rewards pool during the three-month duration starting from the anticipated provisional launch date. Further details regarding the timeline will be announced in Q2.    

[Karel Kubat](https://x.com/0xkaiserkarel), Founder and CEO of Union Labs, commented: 

> _“Lava’s alignment with our standards for security, speed, and reliability, make this partnership a natural fit - one that’s beneficial to our entire community. The speed at which Lava Network operates is critical for Web3 applications, which often need hundreds of RPC calls for a single screen to function smoothly and update data in real-time. This steadfast commitment to speed and security is not just a technical consideration—as one simply cannot effectively interact with the network without RPC—but a fundamental driver of enhanced UX and overall ecosystem growth."_ 

Lava serves as a modular network of RPC node operators, providing low latency and high availability access to any blockchain. Through Lava’s technology, relays are intelligently routed to the best available nodes based on user geolocation to ensure an optimized experience. Together, Union and Lava also optimize cost-efficiency for the chain, as node runners are duly rewarded for their quality of service. 

Yair Cleper, CEO and Co-founder at Lava, concluded: 

> _"We’re delighted to partner with Union to offer developers and users high performance connections to blockchains. As blockchain adoption continues to grow, access and interoperability are the two key factors for scaling onboarding. Lava and Union share a vision to let developers build whatever, wherever."_

## About Lava

[Lava Network](https://www.lavanet.xyz/) is the modular access layer for blockchains. Lava routes user queries through a decentralized network of data providers, prioritizing fast and reliable responses. Providers on Lava can dynamically add and serve modules representing different types of infrastructure. The network is initially working with chains to scale and optimize their RPC. 

By leveraging modular architecture and peer-to-peer routing, Lava powers a unified access layer for developers and users to connect to blockchains at scale.
