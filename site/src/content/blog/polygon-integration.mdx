Union, the Modular Interoperability Layer, is plugging into the AggLayer, developed by leading L2 developer Polygon Labs, to facilitate message passing and asset transfers between the Polygon ecosystem and IBC-enabled chains. This integration will position Union as the de-facto IBC gateway in and out of the AggLayer, unlocking liquidity flow between two of the largest blockchain ecosystems: Polygon and Cosmos.

The AggLayer was designed to solve the scalability problem in blockchain, which refers to scaling access to shared state and liquidity across multiple chains. To address this requires a new approach to blockchain architecture, namely, aggregated blockchains. Polygon Labs researchers and engineers have designed a solution – the aggregation layer, or AggLayer – which will seamlessly connect any ZK-enabled L2 or L1 chain, regardless of execution environment, for near-instant cross-chain transactions, and shared state and liquidity across chains.
 
This includes chains leveraging Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK), a modular, open source software toolkit for blockchain developers which supports the installation and configuration of a variety of chain architectures. Polygon CDK empowers developers to launch new L2 chains running Polygon zkEVM technology on Ethereum or, in the future, transition existing Layer 1 (L1) chains into zkEVM L2s.


The engineering team at Union and the research team at Polygon Labs will integrate Union's ZK proofs for IBC into the AggLayer. This integration aims to facilitate the seamless bridging of funds from any IBC-enabled chain to any blockchain connected to the AggLayer, ensuring a trustless, efficient, and low-latency process.

Immediate access to the widely-utilized IBC bridging protocol will provide numerous advantages for blockchains connected to the AggLayer, including:

- Seamless access to liquidity without vendor lock-in
- Freedom for technical innovation through open standards
- Unrestricted liquidity movement and composability with other Web3 protocols
- Singular connection for interoperability with a basically unlimited number of chains


Union's two-way interoperability solution is also set to promote the smooth flow of liquidity and reduce user fragmentation between two modular ecosystems. Union’s collaborations within the Celestia modular stack will connect the AggLayer with the Celestia ecosystem, enabling the free flow of native asset liquidity across these networks and further enhancing the utility of native assets within the Polygon ecosystem.


Union Founder, Karel Kubat, said:


> _“The integration between Union and the AggLayer, developed by Polygon Labs, extends beyond a physical integration; it is a testament to both projects’ commitment to addressing the siloed nature of blockchains while upholding sovereignty. A secure link between AggLayer-connected blockchains and IBC-enabled chains will greatly benefit projects in both ecosystems and developers looking for the freedom afforded by the modular design and zk-proof bridging technology.”_

_“Union’s integration into the AggLayer is a significant milestone for both the Polygon and Cosmos ecosystems leveraging the AggLayer’s unique architecture to unlock modular and monolithic benefits for both ecosystems,”_ said Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs. _“It streamlines liquidity flow for current projects and users while catalyzing innovation.”_
