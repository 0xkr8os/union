# Galoisd

Galois daemon (galoisd) is a gRPC service providing consensus proof generation for CometBLS block headers. It requires another service, such as an IBC relayer, to send block data for zpk generation.

## Usage

Call `galoisd --help` to see an up-to-date overview of functions. The CLI is self-documenting.

### Local development

- Enter the union devshell with `nix develop`
- Run galoisd `nix run .#galoisd -- --help`

## Production Deployments

> **Warning**
>
> galoisd is not designed to be a public service. Proving is a computationally intensive process. Incorrectly configuring the service can lead to denial-of-service attacks.
